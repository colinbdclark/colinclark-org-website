            <p class="bio-long">Colin Clark is the Lead Software Architect at OCAD University's Inclusive Design Research Centre, where he has worked as a design researcher for over 20 years. He is co-founder of the Fluid Project, an open source community dedicated to creating new co-design practices and tools. Colin's design practice focuses on the development of open source collaborative tools for creative expression, including <a href="https://github.com/colinbdclark/aconite">Flocking</a>, a web-based sound synthesis and data sonification framework, and <a href="https://github.com/colinbdclark/aconite">Aconite</a>, a video sequencing and compositing toolkit. His software tools have been used by an international community of composers, artists, and researchers. As a video artist, Colin's work explores technology, time, and nature using a personal algorithmic approach. He has composed soundtracks for films by Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof and R. Bruce Elder which have been shown at film festivals and cinematheques internationally. In 2016, Colin completed an MFA from OCAD University in Interdisciplinary Art, Media, and Design. He has been a member of the Toronto media art collective, the Loop Collective, since 2001.</p>
