                Colin Clark is a video artist and software designer. His practice explores the ways that technologies produce new temporalities and senses of time, often by combining and repurposing sonic processes in the production of visual media. Colin's work uses homemade signal processing algorithms, which he shares with others as open source software. He is the creator of <a href="http://flockingjs.org">Flocking</a>, a web-based sound synthesis and data sonification framework, <a href="https://github.com/colinbdclark/aconite">Aconite</a>, a web video sequencing and compositing toolkit, and other <a href="software">software tools for artists</a>, which have been used in artworks and software projects by a community of international contributors.</p>

                <p>Colin is the Associate Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre and Adjunct Professor in the School of Graduate Studies at OCAD University. His research is concerned with issues of access and agency within technology-mediated creative practice. Colin works alongside open communities to co-design new (and rediscover old) ways to build and sustain cooperative, reciprocal software systems&mdash;especially by those without access to conventional programming expertise. At the IDRC, Colin leads a variety of applied research projects that support participation in digital art and culture, cooperative and equitable digital platforms, community-based co-design methods, and inclusive software architectures.</p>

                <p>As a composer, his music has been performed by Arraymusic, the neither/nor collective, the Draperies, and his own ensembles, Lions and Fleischmop. Colin has composed soundtracks for films by Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof and R. Bruce Elder that have been shown at film festivals and cinematheques internationally. Colin holds an MFA from OCAD University in Interdisciplinary Art, Media, and Design. He has been a member of Toronto's Loop Collective since 2001.</p>
