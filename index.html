                Colin Clark is a video artist and software designer. His practice explores connections and adjacencies between nature, digital technology, and duration. His videos are often made using homemade signal processing algorithms, which he shares with others as open source software. He is the creator of <a href="http://flockingjs.org">Flocking</a>, a web-based sound synthesis and data sonification framework, and <a href="https://github.com/colinbdclark/aconite">Aconite</a>, a web video sequencing and compositing toolkit. His software tools are used by an international community of musicians, artists, and researchers.</p>

                <p>Colin is the Associate Director at OCAD University's Inclusive Design Research Centre, where he has worked as a design researcher for over 20 years. He is co-founder of the Fluid Project, anÂ open source community dedicated to creating new co-design practices, democratic software frameworks, and authoring tools. Colin's research interests include:  community-based, participatory design methods; creative and artistic inclusion; sonification and multimodality; and new programming systems that support design and development by "users."</p>

                <p>As a composer, his music has been performed by Arraymusic, the neither/nor collective, the Draperies, and his own ensembles, Lions and Fleischmop. Colin has composed soundtracks for films by Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof and R. Bruce Elder which have been shown at film festivals and cinematheques internationally. Colin holds an MFA from OCAD University in Interdisciplinary Art, Media, and Design. He has been a member of Toronto's Loop Collective since 2001.</p>
