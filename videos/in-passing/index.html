                <p>This dried-up old leaf fades and finds new life through digital transformation.</p>

                <p>It was the kind of scene that would have been easy to miss: an old leaf had blown into the house on a windy summer day and became tangled in cobwebs in the corner, flickering aimlessly with the breeze. I tried to use my camera to amplify the small energies, and then to use the computer's signals to modulate and expand these energies into something else. A small reflection&mdash;seen, heard, and hopefully felt.</p>
