# To Do

* Add more videos to the Videos page
* Split the software section into individual pages for each, and create a more visual grid for the top-level software page
* Create a proper page for Music, which will include links to SoundCloud, embedded Flocking players, and links to scores
* Consider a logo for the main page?
