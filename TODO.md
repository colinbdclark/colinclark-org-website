* Add more videos to the Videos page
* Resize images for the Videos page
* Find a good contrasting header typeface and one for the video captions
* Improve small and large screen layout
    * Header shouldn't break
    * Video images shouldn't resize overly
    * Larger type
    * narrower column for wide screens
* Create a proper page for Music, which will include links to SoundCloud, embedded Flocking players, and links to scores
* Consider a logo for the main page?
